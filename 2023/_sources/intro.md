# Overview

## Who to contact

For queries about adding or dropping modules from your record, contact [natsci@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:natsci@ucl.ac.uk).

If you want to have a discussion about the suitability of your choices, contact the relevant Stream Leader.

Requests for more information about a particular module should normally be directed to the module organiser. Their contact details can be found via the [module catalogue](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/module-catalogue-index?collection=drupal-module-catalogue&facetsort=alpha&num_ranks=20&daat=10000&sort=title).


## Email Guidelines
Here are some general tips that you can follow when writing emails to staff members.

Do:
* Use your UCL email address for all correspondence and check your UCL email account at least every day on Monday – Friday during term time. We will not respond to emails sent from a personal email address.

* Include your student number and say who you are. For instance: “I am a Natural Sciences student resitting year 2. My streams are physics and physical chemistry, and I am planning to major in physics”. You may find it helpful to construct an e-mail signature so that you don’t have to think about doing this every time you write an e-mail. An example e-mail signature is provided in Section 4.2.

* Offer solutions if it is practical to do so. Say what steps you have already taken to address the query, and how successful you think those steps were.

* Continue the “thread” by including all previous responses. Most email clients do this by default. If you have had a separate discussion about the topic with another member of staff, it is possible to include a copy of the previous discussion as an attachment if the information is not sensitive or confidential.

* Be aware that other students may have similar queries. Consider involving the relevant students in your query and consult your Stream Leaders.

Don’t
* Send separate copies of the same email to different people. This is frustrating for staff, who then waste time answering a query that may already have been addressed by somebody else. Instead, decide who is the most relevant person to send the email to, and include the other people in the “c.c.” field.

* Send an email without checking the Natural Sciences Moodle page and Student Handbook first, to see if the answer to your query can be found there.

## Electronic Signatures
Here is an example of an electronic signature that you can add to your email. 

Your Full Name | BSc Natural Sciences Student (Organic Chemistry and Biomedical Sciences) – Year 2
UCL Student Number 1700000001

The method used to add an electronic signature will depend on the email client that you are using. For example, [here are the guidelines when using Microsoft Office](https://goo.gl/yNFZBj)
